I received my B.S. in Automation from Shenzhen University in 2020. Currently, I am a first year master student with the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Shenzhen University, under supervision of [Prof. Weike Pan](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/panwk/index.html).

# Research Interest
My personal research focuses on Counterfactual Machine Learning for Recommendation Systems, which aims to solve various bias issues existing in the system, such as selection bias, position bias, and popularity bias. In addition, I am also studying content related to natural language processing.
